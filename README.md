# osm-nik4-docker

This container allows you to easily set up an OpenStreetMap PNG renderer using `nik4` given a `.osm` file. It is based on the [Overv's openstreetmap-tile-server](https://github.com/Overv/openstreetmap-tile-server/) and uses the default `openstreetmap-carto` style. This is not a server, it's intended to be run once to render an image.

## Setting up the renderer

First create a Docker volume to hold the PostgreSQL database that will contain the OpenStreetMap data:

    docker volume create openstreetmap-data

Next, create or download an .osm file that you want to render. You can then start importing it into PostgreSQL by running a container and mounting the file as `/data.osm`. For example:

```
docker run \
    -v /absolute/path/to/file.osm:/data.osm \
    -v openstreetmap-data:/var/lib/postgresql/12/main \
    osm-nik4-docker \
    import
```

If the container exits without errors, then your data has been successfully imported and you are now ready to run the renderer.

## Rendering

Run the renderer like this, mounting an output directory as `/output/`:

```
docker run \
    -v /absolute/path/to/output/:/output/ \
    -v openstreetmap-data:/var/lib/postgresql/12/main \
    -d osm-nik4-docker \
    render
```

Your rendered image will now be availaible in `/output/`
